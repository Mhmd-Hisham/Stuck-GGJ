Stuck is an Oculus Rift S VR game in which a player can rewind time and traverse in space in order to change the consequences of his actions and fix fate in an endless psychedelic tunnel in which you will try to cheat time and death to get out of the loop and fix the events. Time can be twisted but your fate is written. Synchronize your fears, but you can't fix everything. Rewind, traverse, run and wish for the best but fate has already been written. Can you fix it?
